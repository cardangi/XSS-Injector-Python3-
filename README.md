## Functions
This is created for helping some web developers to check if a persistent XSS could hurt their website.
`Not for bad purposes.`

### Options and Usage
There are ~~simple options and a very, very basic usage~~ Only one option that works actually.
```
Example: python/py xsspersistent.py --arg

--target (Set the target)
--adv (Later, i will add some advanced options, like post xss, advanced xss ways, and own config xss)
```
